This React project was made with typescript, node sass, react router, and many more libraries that helped in the process!
The idea is to have a small site where you can have solid material that anyone who wants to join the world of web development can quickly consult and create a network of connections with people who also love what they do! 
I hope you like it and any suggestions you can write to my linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/mat√≠as-edgardo-marazza-cantero/
Have a nice day! :)
