            No matter how experienced a web developer you are, programming is a
            process of constantly learning. As new technologies and frameworks
            are released, youâ€™ll have to keep yourself informed to remain
            competitive. Dive into Stack Overflow and GitHub to find the answers
            to questions you have, or just to scan through the questions other
            developers are asking.

            It is recommended at first to see several tutorials and understand what they do but be careful! Always code at the same time as you follow a tutorial, so you can see how it is implemented and why they do things that way.

            screen, but do not be discouraged! It is important that you always
            keep trying and go ahead, there will always be people who went
            through the same problem who can help you, or find a solution with
            you!
