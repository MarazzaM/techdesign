          No matter how experienced a web developer you are, programming is a
          process of constantly learning. As new technologies and frameworks are
          released, youâ€™ll have to keep yourself informed to remain competitive.
          Dive into Stack Overflow and GitHub to find the answers to questions
          you have, or just to scan through the questions other developers are
          asking. Develop a reading list of industry blogs and magazines.
